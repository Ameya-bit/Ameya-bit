## Featured projects

- 🔎 **CanvAI** – Semantic search for course content  
  - Built the core semantic search platform using **FAISS** and **HuggingFace embeddings** to retrieve Canvas content (notes, grades, assignments) with sub‑second latency across entire courses.  
  - Designed CSV processing + text extraction for multiple file types and a hybrid search engine with automatic course code detection and multi-layered caching.  

- 🛡 **Web Vulnerabilities Study** – Practical security research  
  - 30‑day self-directed study of 7 common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQLi, IDOR, OAuth issues, open redirects, sensitive data exposure), documenting 25+ potential attack vectors.  
  - Implemented 30+ generalized defensive code examples in **Rust, Python, PowerShell, PL/pgSQL** and organized best‑practice modules used by 20+ peers.
